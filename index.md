# ASI Systems Immunology x OzSingleCell Hackathon 2023

Welcome to the ASI - OzSingleCell Hackathon in 2023!

This year's theme is focused on "Clonal Biology" and will bring together early-career researchers and leaders in single cell genomics, clonal biology, and immunology to tackle some of the grand challenges that exist in the analysis and interpretation of clonally-related cells in single-cell genomic datasets.

Cells sharing the same clonal origins contain identical sets of genetic material and they pass this on to their progeny.
Recent advances in single-cell analysis has allowed for the simultaneous detection of the transcriptome and other modes of data to allow us to track a cell's clonality, which has revolutionised our capacity to understand single cell types and their fates and origins.
This is particularly notable in the field of immunology, particularly for studies working on clonal selection of B and T lymphocytes.
Recent advances in single-cell lineage tracing technologies have also been applied to other cell types, such as dendritic cells or cancer cells. 
Regardless of the technology used to identify clonally-related cells, or the biological system, many challenges and opportunities exist in terms of testing biologically meaningful hypothesis with such sparse and complex datasets.

The hackathon aims to bring together experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) scientists working in the field of clonal biology, including those working with single-cell technologies like lentiviral barcoding, BCR/TCR clonotyping, and mitochondrial lineage tracing. 
Others from disparate fields such as UX/UI engineers, AI/ML, deep learning, graph neural networks, computer vision or image preprocessing, causal inference are also encouraged to attend.
Data challenges may involve developing new methods for intra-/inter-clonal gene expression signatures, data architecture of clonotype information, or data visualisation.

By spending time in a room together, this event aims to foster new collaborations, connections and tools to build on Australia's capabilities in single-cell genomics. The intended outcomes for this workshop are:

* Seeding of new projects and collaborations
* New tools for single-cell clonality visualisation and/or analysis
* Publication of a Grand Challenges summary
